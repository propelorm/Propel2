# This is a project-specific build.properties file.  The properties
# in this file override anything set in Propel's top-level build.properties
# file when *this* project is being built.
#
# See top-level build.properties-sample for explanation of configuration 
# options.
#
# Because this file is included before the top-level build.properties file, 
# you cannot refer to any properties set therein.
