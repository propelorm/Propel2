# List of Backwards Incompatible Changes

## Tasks become Commands... and change names

The Phing tasks that you used at buildtime are now refactored to Commands using the Symfony2 Command component. They work the same, but their name has changed.

    Replace...           With...
    build-model          model:build
    build-sql            sql:build
    insert-sql           sql:insert
    convert-conf         config:convert-xml
    diff                 [not yet refactored]
    status               migration:status
    migrate              [not yet refactored]
    up                   migration:up
    down                 migration:down
    reverse              [not yet refactored]

## `Propel\Runtime\Propel` methods renamed.

Some static methods from the `Propel` class have been renamed. Therefore, you must replace the following occurrences in your code:

    Replace...                                              With...
    Propel::CONNECTION_WRITE                                ServiceContainerInterface::CONNECTION_WRITE
    Propel::CONNECTION_READ                                 ServiceContainerInterface::CONNECTION_READ
    Propel::getDB($name)                                    Propel::getAdapter($name)
    Propel::getConnection($name, Propel::CONNECTION_READ)   Propel::getReadConnection($name)
    Propel::getConnection($name, Propel::CONNECTION_WRITE)  Propel::getWriteConnection($name)
    Propel::getDefaultDB()                                  Propel::getDefaultDatasource()

The generated model is automatically updated once you rebuild your model.

>**Tip**: Internally, `Propel::getAdapter()` proxies to `Propel::getServiceContainer()->getAdapter()`. The `Propel` class was refactored to keep only one static class and to be more extensible. It remains the easy entry point to all the necessary services provided by Propel.

`Propel::setConnection()` is removed. As for `Propel::init($configFilePath)`, where `$configFilePath` is the path to the PHP configuration generated by the `config:convert-xml` command, you can now replace it with `include $configFilePath`.
## Builders renamed

The classes used by Propel internally to build the object model were renamed. This affects your project if you extended one of these classes.

    Replace...                       With...
    OMBuilder.php                    AbstractOMBuilder.php
    ObjectBuilder.php                AbstractObjectBuilder.php
    PeerBuilder.php                  AbstractPeerBuilder.php
    PHP5ExtensionObjectBuilder.php   ExtensionObjectBuilder.php
    PHP5ExtensionPeerBuilder.php     ExtensionPeerBuilder.php
    PHP5InterfaceBuilder.php         InterfaceBuilder.php
    PHP5MultiExtendObjectBuilder.php MultiExtendObjectBuilder.php
    PHP5ObjectBuilder.php            ObjectBuilder.php
    PHP5PeerBuilder.php              PeerBuilder.php
    PHP5TableMapBuilder.php          TableMapBuilder.php

## Base classes reorganized

Base classes are generated in a `Base` directory, and base classes are no more prefixed by `Base`.

Parameters `basePrefix` and `namespaceOm` have been removed

## `Propel\Generator\Model\Database` methods renamed.

Before:

    public function setAppData(AppData $parent)

After:

    public function setParentSchema(Schema $parent)

Before:

    public function getAppData()

After:

    public function getParentSchema()

## `Propel\Generator\Model\AppData` class has been renamed to `Schema`.

The `AppData::joinAppDatas` method has been renamed to `Schema::joinSchemas`.

Before:

    public function joinAppDatas($ads)

After:

    public function joinSchemas($schemas)

## `Propel\Generator\Builder\Util\XmlToAppData` class has been renamed to `SchemaReader`.

Both `SchemaReader::parseString` and `SchemaReader::parseFile` methods return
a `Propel\Generator\Model\Schema` object instead of a `Propel\Generator\Model\AppData` object.

## `Propel\Generator\Util\SchemaValidator` constructor signature changed.

Before:

    public function __construct(AppData $appData)

After:

    public function __construct(Schema $schema)

## `Propel\Generator\Model\Table::containsColumn` method has been removed.
