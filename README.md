[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/propelorm/Propel2.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/propelorm/Propel2)


## Requirements ##

Propel2 uses the following Symfony2 Components:

* [Console](https://github.com/symfony/Console)

* [Finder](https://github.com/symfony/Finder)
* [Validator](https://github.com/symfony/Validator)
* [Filesystem](https://github.com/symfony/Filesystem)

Propel2 also relies on [**Composer**](https://github.com/composer/composer) to manage dependencies but you
also can use [ClassLoader](https://github.com/symfony/ClassLoader) (see the `autoload.php.dist` file for instance).

Propel2 is only supported on PHP 5.4 and up.
