 * Note that if you have specified the size attribute in the column tag

 * this is done automatically.
 *
 * <code>
 *   <column name="username" type="VARCHAR" size="25" required="true" />
 *
 *   <validator column="username">
 *     <rule name="maxLength" message="Passwort must be at least ${value} characters !" />
 *   </validator>
