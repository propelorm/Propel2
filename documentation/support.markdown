# Support #

There are several ways to get help when you are having problems with Propel.


## Mailing Lists ##

In order to ask for support or help other users, use the **Propel Users** mailing-list:

[http://groups.google.com/group/propel-users](http://groups.google.com/group/propel-users)

If you want to help with the development of Propel, or if you want to be informed of the upcoming features, subscribe to the **Propel Development** mailing-list:

[http://groups.google.com/group/propel-development](http://groups.google.com/group/propel-development)

These lists were created in May 2009. A previous set mailing-lists were hosted by tigris.org, you can still consult the archives:

* [Users list archives](http://propel.tigris.org/ds/viewForumSummary.do?dsForumId=1097)
* [Development list archives](http://propel.tigris.org/ds/viewForumSummary.do?dsForumId=1093)


## IRC ##

The [#propel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=propel) channel on **irc.freenode.net** is an informal meeting place for discussing new ideas, asking support questions, or just airing general frustrations with the PHP5 engine :)


## Bug Reports ##

>**Tip**<br />Since 2011, the Propel project is hosted and managed on [GitHub](http://github.com).

You can look at the [Propel organization](https://github.com/propelorm) and to report bugs or to ask for new features to the [Propel ticketing system](https://github.com/propelorm/Propel2/issues).
